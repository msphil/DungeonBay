Your one-stop shop for worthless virtual goods purchased with imaginary gold pieces.

GMs: Create your custom shop and stock it with weapons, equipment, magic spells, and novelty items.

Players: Buy, sell, trade, barter, or plead for someone to take an item off your hands. Who knows, maybe you can finally get rid of that +3 Sword of Yodeling.
